# google-maps-project
A project i did for college

I use the python google maps api for getting distance between two locations (for example, the distance between Buenos Aires and Mar del plata)

I use the tkinter python library to make the gui for the program. 

To do:

. Implement the GUI.
. Fixing possible bugs.
. Make installers for different operating systems(Windows, Linux, maybe Mac os).
