# google-maps-project
A project i did for college

I use the python google maps api for getting distance between two locations (for example, the distance between Buenos Aires and Mar del plata)

In this project you can make via command line a route across different cities. For example, you can make a route that goes throught Buenos Aires, Rosario and Cordoba. Get the distance between each city and the time needed to finish the route by car


To do:

. Implement an GUI. I have to decide if make it with tkinter or pyqt5
. Fixing possible bugs.
. Make installers for different operating systems.
